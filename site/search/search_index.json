However, this approach led to increased complexity and system failures.

Who are you, what do you do for a living, and where do you work?</p> <p>My name is Paul B\u00fctow, I work at Mimecast, and I\u2019m a Principal Site Reliability Engineer there. I\u2019ve been with Mimecast for almost ten years now. The company specializes in email security, including things like archiving, phishing detection, malware protection, and spam filtering.</p> <p>You mentioned that you\u2019re an \u2018Embedded SRE.\u2019 What does that mean exactly?</p> <p>It means that I\u2019m directly part of the software engineering team, not in a separate Ops department. I ensure that nothing is deployed manually, and everything runs through automation. I also set up monitoring and observability. These are two distinct aspects: monitoring alerts us when something breaks, while observability helps us identify trends. I also create runbooks so we know what to do when specific incidents occur frequently.</p> <p>Infrastructure SREs on the other hand handle the foundational setup, like providing the Kubernetes cluster itself or ensuring the operating systems are installed. They don't work on the application directly but ensure the base infrastructure is there for others to use.

We had a PC with DOS at home, and I eventually bought Suse Linux 5.3. Shortly after, I discovered FreeBSD because I liked its handbook so much. I wanted to understand exactly how everything worked, so I also tried Linux from Scratch. That involves installing every package manually to gain a better understanding of operating systems.</p> <p>And after school, you pursued computer science, correct?</p> <p>Exactly. I wasn\u2019t sure at first whether I wanted to be a software developer or a system administrator. I applied for both and eventually accepted an offer as a Linux system administrator. This was before 'SRE' became a buzzword, but much of what I did back then-automation, infrastructure as code, monitoring-is now considered part of the typical SRE role.</p>","tags":["Site Reliability Engineering","Automation","Runbooks","Collaboration","AI in SRE"]},{"location":"writing/2025/01/12/working-with-an-sre-interview/#roles-and-career-progression","title":"Roles and Career Progression","text":"<p>Tell us about how you joined Mimecast. When did you fully embrace the SRE role?</p> <p>I started as a Linux sysadmin at 1&amp;1. I managed an ad server farm with hundreds of systems and later handled load balancers. Together with an architect, we managed F5 load balancers distributing around 2,000 services, including for portals like web.de and GMX. I also led the operations team technically for a while before moving to London to join Mimecast.</p> <p>At Mimecast, the job title was explicitly 'Site Reliability Engineer.' The biggest difference was that I was no longer in a separate Ops department but embedded directly within the storage and search backend team. I loved that because we could plan features together-from automation to measurability and observability. Mimecast also operates thousands of physical servers for email archiving, which was fascinating since I already had experience with large distributed systems at 1&amp;1. It was the right step for me because it allowed me to work close to the code while remaining hands-on with infrastructure.</p> <p>What are the differences between SRE, DevOps, SysAdmin, and Architects?</p> <p>SREs are like the next step after SysAdmins. A SysAdmin might manually install servers, replace disks, or use simple scripts for automation, while SREs use infrastructure as code and focus on reliability through SLIs, SLOs, and automation. DevOps isn\u2019t really a job-it\u2019s more of a way of working, where developers are involved in operations tasks like setting up CI/CD pipelines. Architects focus on designing systems and infrastructures, such as load balancers or distributed systems, working alongside SREs to ensure the systems meet the reliability and scalability requirements. The specific responsibilities of each role depend on the company, and there is often overlap. </p> <p>What are the most important reliability lessons you\u2019ve learned so far?</p> <p>Don\u2019t leave SRE aspects as an afterthought. It\u2019s much better to discuss automation, monitoring, SLIs, and SLOs early on. Traditional sysadmins often installed systems manually, but today, we do everything via infrastructure as code-using tools like Terraform or Puppet. I also distinguish between monitoring and observability. Monitoring tells us, 'The server is down, alarm!' Observability dives deeper, showing trends like increasing latency so we can act proactively. SLI, SLO, and SLA are core elements. We focus on what users actually experience-for example, how quickly an email is sent-and set our goals accordingly. Runbooks are also crucial. When something goes wrong at night, you don\u2019t want to start from scratch. A runbook outlines how to debug and resolve specific problems, saving time and reducing downtime.</p>","tags":["Site Reliability Engineering","Automation","Runbooks","Collaboration","AI in SRE"]},{"location":"writing/2025/01/12/working-with-an-sre-interview/#anecdotes-and-best-practices","title":"Anecdotes and Best Practices","text":"<p>Runbooks sound very practical. Can you explain how they\u2019re used day-to-day?</p> <p>Runbooks are essentially guides for handling specific incidents. For instance, if a service won\u2019t start, the runbook will specify where the logs are and which commands to use. Observability takes it a step further, helping us spot changes early-like rising error rates or latency-so we can address issues before they escalate.</p> <p>When should you decide to put something into a runbook, and when is it unnecessary?</p> <p>If an issue happens frequently, it should be documented in a runbook so that anyone, even someone new, can follow the steps to fix it. The idea is that 90% of the common incidents should be covered. For example, if a service is down, the runbook would specify where to find logs, which commands to check, and what actions to take. On the other hand, rare or complex issues, where the resolution depends heavily on context or varies each time, don\u2019t make sense to include in detail. For those, it\u2019s better to focus on general troubleshooting steps. </p> <p>How do you search for and find the correct runbooks?</p> <p>Runbooks should be linked directly in the alert you receive. For example, if you get an alert about a service not running, the alert will have a link to the runbook that tells you what to check, like logs or commands to run. Runbooks are best stored in an internal wiki, so if you don\u2019t find the link in the alert, you know where to search. The important thing is that runbooks are easy to find and up to date because that\u2019s what makes them useful during incidents. </p> <p>Do you have an interesting war story you can share with us?</p> <p>Sure. At 1&amp;1, we had a proprietary ad server software that ran a SQL query during startup. The query got slower over time, eventually timing out and preventing the server from starting. Since we couldn\u2019t access the source code, we searched the binary for the SQL and patched it. By pinpointing the issue, a developer was able to adjust the SQL.

This avoids unpleasant surprises before going live.</p> <p>How about working with data scientists or ML engineers? Are there differences?</p> <p>The principles are the same. ML models also need to be deployed and monitored. You deal with monitoring, resource allocation, and identifying performance drops.
