# DS/ML Book Club

If you like to read books and discuss them with others, I can recommend the free [Data Science and Machine Learning Book Club](https://discord.gg/ht2MkgnKn5).
Each Month, the community votes on a book for members to read and discuss asynchronously on Discord. Often, there is an interesting live post-reading discussion with the authors on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2KLV6jxFCI2UJy6RhQagZF82jnaa7gx_).

Some of the past readings made it into my [reading list](books.md).
