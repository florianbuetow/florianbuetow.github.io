# A Guide to Working with Me

Welcome! This guide is meant to help us work together more effectively by sharing my preferences and work style. While it may seem formal, think of it as a friendly "user manual" that can help reduce misunderstandings and make our collaboration smoother. These aren't rigid rules - they're simply patterns I've found helpful throughout my career. Feel free to use this as a starting point for discussion, and know that I'm always open to adapting based on what works best for us team.

## About Me

- Location: Originally from Germany, currently based in the UK/EU.
- Professional Background: Experienced in backend software engineering (ex-Reddit), data science, and data engineering, with a focus on information retrieval (search) and building distributed, data-intensive applications and platforms.
- What Drives Me: I thrive on interesting challenges and love working with bright, motivated colleagues who share a passion for problem-solving and growth.

## Collaboration Style

> Teamwork is like team sports: In basketball, everyone has a specific skill and plays a specific position (sometimes multiple), and when the moment requires it, we give each other assists to win as a team.

### Preferred Communication

- Verbal or direct messages (DMs).

### Collaboration Values

- Genuine interest in completing work together.
- Ensuring everyone feels useful, and their contributions are valued.
- A focus on tasks, with teamwork driven by mission and learning, not ego.

### Decision-Making

I like to think my decisions are very rational and data-driven, but I also know when to deviate from that and let intuition lead the way.

- Analytical Decisions: Data-driven (for defensibility); if data is lacking, use experience as a proxy.
- Social Decisions: Guided by intuition, but rationalised with experiences, especially for decisions that affect if and how we work together.
- Getting Buy-In: Engineering is collaborative enterprise, being a hero engineer only gets you so far (trust me I've been there). That is why I prefer a collaborative approach that leads to not only more informed decisions but also to a buy-in from the majority of the participants.

### Interaction Style

- Formal when needed.
- Always respectful, outcome-focused, and intentional. I often like to understand the why and intention behind what we are trying to achieve. If you find me probing for a reason, it is not because I have doubts. It is because understanding the reason helps me to map different paths to the goal.
- When I am not in focused mode, I like talking about ideas and challenges. Despite being German, I love a good laugh too! Not all chats have to mean business.

### Meeting Preferences

- Clear purpose and agenda required beforehand.
- Meetings should always have outcome intentions.
- I prefer no meetings before lunch to focus deeply on my work.

## A typical Workday

This is my typical routine. While not set in stone, these are some of the pattern that worked well in the past for me.

- Mornings: Focused, using the Pomodoro technique with noise-cancelling headphones. Unless it is urgent, please send a DM and allow me to respond asynchronously.
- Pre-lunch: I catch up on emails and messages.
- Around Lunchtime: I'm open to socialising and chatting. Connecting with others energises me and sparks new ideas. Many of my side projects at work got started this way.
- Afternoons: Great for meetings, asking for my help, or brainstorming ideas.

## As a Lead/Manager

> A team is like a fist; it is only as strong as the individual fingers that hold together. — Karin S.

- I'll shield the team from outside pressure, and we'll tackle challenges as a team together.
- I'm fine with silliness and fun at work as long as our tasks are completed by us. Some of my most enjoyable moments in my career involved playing pranks on our line manager while delivering a distributed search and storage backend across thousands of servers in a dozen data centres, managing 100 petabytes of data.
- Enjoy your work, and show what you can do.
- I prioritise understanding errors in context rather than attributing them to personal traits (lookup "Fundamental Attribution Error"). I care about how you learn from mistakes to grow.
- I understand that people have different preferences, personalities, and quirks. And sometimes people simply just don't like each other. If you have a work conflict, I'll encourage you and the other party to talk it out and negotiate a win-win solution.

## Feedback

### How I Give Feedback

- Positive Feedback: Delivered promptly and publicly (or privately if we have rapport) — always genuine, never forced.
- Constructive Feedback: Discussed privately, focusing on problem-solving. I might ask, "What do you think we need to do to fix X?" to encourage solutions rather than dwell on mistakes. I'm there to assist you in resolving issues.

### How I'd Like to Receive Feedback

- Genuine, verbal, informal, and timely — focused on actionable steps for personal or professional growth.

## What I Find Most Helpful or Challenging to Deal With

> The easiest way to become a 10x engineer is to help five 1x engineers become 2x engineers.

### Most Helpful

- Being yourself and sharing positivity makes it easy to approach and appreciate you.
- Communicating clearly with relevant information (+updates and successes).
- Meetings with agendas and actionable outcomes.
- When I need help, show me how to help myself next time.

### Most Challenging

- People who are gatekeeping / arrogant / dismissive.
- People who only take but don't give.
- People who focus only on the negative.
- Non-technical managers with zero experience.
